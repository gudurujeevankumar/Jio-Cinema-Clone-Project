# 🎬 JioCinema Website Clone

This is my **very first website project** – a simple **JioCinema clone** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
I started building this without knowing anything about web development — no HTML, no CSS — just pure curiosity and a desire to learn.

This project marks the beginning of my **web development journey** and is very close to my heart. 💖

## 🚀 Project Description

- Inspired by a **Let'sUpgrade webinar** where a React version of the JioCinema website was built.
- I decided to challenge myself and try creating a static clone using only **HTML** and **CSS**.
- This project helped me **learn the basics of web structure, styling, layout, and page building.**

> “Even though I didn’t know where to begin, I started learning step by step by building this site — and that’s how I fell in love with web development.”
